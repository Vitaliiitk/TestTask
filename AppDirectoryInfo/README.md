The assignment is to create an application that has one input - a directory path. The application loads the information about the given directory (all files
and nested directories, and saves the information):

1) For each directory, save its name, a list of all files, and a list of all nested directories it contains.
2) For each file, save its name and extension.

The application supports the following functionalities:

1) Print all unique file extensions.
2) Serialize the directory information into JSON format.
3) Save the JSON to a file.
4) Deserialize the JSON file containing the directory information.

I tried to adhere to an object-oriented approach to development. xUnit test project with some testing was also added to the assignment.
